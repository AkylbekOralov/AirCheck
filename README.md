# AirCheck ðŸ’¨

This is an iOS app built with UIKit that helps users monitor air quality indexes (AQI) around them. The app visualizes real-time AQI data from nearby stations on an interactive map and includes a convenient home screen widget powered by WidgetKit.

## Overview
AirCheck displays AQI data directly on a map, showing the current air quality near the userâ€™s location. It also allows users to search for any place and instantly view the AQI in that region.

## Why This Project
AirCheck was developed as a practical iOS app to deepen my experience with UIKit, MapKit alternatives (Mapbox), and building WidgetKit extensions. It integrates live data from an air quality API and offers a polished, user-friendly UI with clean architecture.

## Features
- Interactive map showing AQI stations
- Live AQI readings around the userâ€™s current location
- Search for any city or location and view AQI
- WidgetKit support â€” quickly view the nearest AQI directly from the main screen
- Optimized for both light and dark mode

## Technologies Used
- UIKit
- Mapbox â€“ for the interactive map
- Alamofire â€“ for networking/API calls
- SnapKit â€“ for elegant Auto Layout
- WidgetKit â€“ for home screen AQI widget
